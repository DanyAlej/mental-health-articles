    "content": "your mental health influences how you think, feel, and behave in daily life. it also affects your ability to cope with stress, overcome challenges, build relationships, and recover from life’s setbacks and hardships.  strong mental health isn’t just the absence of mental health problems. being mentally or emotionally healthy is much more than being free of depression, anxiety, or other psychological issues. rather than the absence of mental illness, mental health refers to the presence of positive characteristics. anyone can suffer from mental or emotional health problems—and over a lifetime most of us will. this year alone, about one in five of us will suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder. yet, despite how common mental health problems are, many of us make no effort to improve our situation.  we ignore the emotional messages that tell us something is wrong and try toughing it out by distracting ourselves or self-medicating with alcohol, drugs, or self-destructive behaviors. we bottle up our problems in the hope that others won’t notice. we hope that our situation will eventually improve on its own. or we simply give up—telling ourselves this is “just the way we are.”  the good news is: you don’t have to feel bad. there are practices you can adopt to elevate your mood, become more resilient, and enjoy life more. but just as it requires effort to build and maintain physical health, so it is with mental health. we have to work harder these days to ensure strong mental health, simply because there are so many ways that life takes a toll on our emotional well-being.

    "content": "uncertain prognoses, looming severe shortages of resources for testing and treatment and for protecting responders and health care providers from infection, imposition of unfamiliar public health measures that infringe on personal freedoms, large and growing financial losses, and conflicting messages from authorities are among the major stressors that undoubtedly will contribute to widespread emotional distress and increased risk for psychiatric illness associated with covid-19. health care providers have an important role in addressing these emotional outcomes as part of the pandemic response. public health emergencies may affect the health, safety, and well-being of both individuals (causing, for example, insecurity, confusion, emotional isolation, and stigma) and communities (owing to economic loss, work and school closures, inadequate resources for medical response, and deficient distribution of necessities). these effects may translate into a range of emotional reactions (such as distress or psychiatric conditions), unhealthy behaviors (such as excessive substance use), and noncompliance with public health directives (such as home confinement and vaccination) in people who contract the disease and in the general population. extensive research in disaster mental health has established that emotional distress is ubiquitous in affected populations — a finding certain to be echoed in populations affected by the covid-19 pandemic. after disasters, most people are resilient and do not succumb to psychopathology. indeed, some people find new strengths. nevertheless, in “conventional” natural disasters, technological accidents, and intentional acts of mass destruction, a primary concern is post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) arising from exposure to trauma. medical conditions from natural causes such as life-threatening viral infection do not meet the current criteria for trauma required for a diagnosis of ptsd,1 but other psychopathology, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, may ensue. some groups may be more vulnerable than others to the psychosocial effects of pandemics. in particular, people who contract the disease, those at heightened risk for it (including the elderly, people with compromised immune function, and those living or receiving care in congregate settings), and people with preexisting medical, psychiatric, or substance use problems are at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes. health care providers are also particularly vulnerable to emotional distress in the current pandemic, given their risk of exposure to the virus, concern about infecting and caring for their loved ones, shortages of personal protective equipment (ppe), longer work hours, and involvement in emotionally and ethically fraught resource-allocation decisions. prevention efforts such as screening for mental health problems, psychoeducation, and psychosocial support should focus on these and other groups at risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes. beyond stresses inherent in the illness itself, mass home-confinement directives (including stay-at-home orders, quarantine, and isolation) are new to americans and raise concern about how people will react individually and collectively. a recent review of psychological sequelae in samples of quarantined people and of health care providers may be instructive; it revealed numerous emotional outcomes, including stress, depression, irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger, frustration, boredom, and stigma associated with quarantine, some of which persisted after the quarantine was lifted. specific stressors included greater duration of confinement, having inadequate supplies, difficulty securing medical care and medications, and resulting financial losses.2 in the current pandemic, the home confinement of large swaths of the population for indefinite periods, differences among the stay-at-home orders issued by various jurisdictions, and conflicting messages from government and public health authorities will most likely intensify distress. a study conducted in communities affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in the early 2000s revealed that although community members, affected individuals, and health care workers were motivated to comply with quarantine to reduce the risk of infecting others and to protect the community’s health, emotional distress tempted some to consider violating their orders.3",
